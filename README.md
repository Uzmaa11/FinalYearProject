# GameLegends: Social Media Website
Developed as part of my Bachelor's degree final year project.
I recieved an A1 for this project.
A social website where users can watch trailers of new video games, posts by other users, and upload posts suggesting tips to help other users. The website also contains basic register/login functionalities. The website was deployed on the XAMPP Apache server. The front end was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. SQL was used as the database.
